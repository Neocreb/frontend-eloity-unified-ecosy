## 🔍 Key Architectural Patterns

All documented with examples in COMPREHENSIVE_DOCUMENTATION.md:

1. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Business logic in `src/services/`
   - Used by components and hooks

2. **Custom Hooks Pattern**
   - Data fetching with React Query
   - `useFeedPosts()`, `useWallet()`, etc.

3. **Context Pattern**
   - Auth context for user state
   - Wallet context for balance
   - Feed context for posts

4. **Component Composition**
   - UI primitives from Radix UI
   - Feature components built from primitives
   - Pages composed from feature components

5. **Direct Supabase Calls**
   - Frontend calls Supabase directly
   - RLS policies control access
   - Real-time subscriptions via Supabase
